2.3.0 - ??? ?? ????

- Change class and method search to use the 'inspect' module to remove slow calls to dir() function. This is most noticable on python2, which I benched at a 40% speed improvement on AdvancedHTMLParser test suite.

- Some micro-optimizations involving using local scope within loops and comprehensions

- Some updates to docstrings and comments

- Fix where old style test names ( just method begins with "test", not necessarily "test_" ) would be used
    in some cases we should be limiting to test_

2.2.0 - Nov 19 2017

- distrib/runTests.py - Change to use sys.executable when executing GoodTests,
which allows you to run as "python2 ./runTests.py" to run test suite in
python2, and "python3 ./runTests.py" to run test suite in python3

- distrib/runTests.py - Improve the fallback pip install for obtaining GoodTests.
It now forces execution to happen with the sys.executable (currently running python
executable). Also instead of blindly relying on the shell to execute "pip
install" properly, we go through the following:
  1. Try to use the pip module directly to install GoodTests
  2. If that fails, try to locate pip executable
     2a.) First, try looking at sys.executable directory for a "pip"
	 executable (so, if running under /opt/python-3.6/bin/python we will try
	 /opt/python-3.6/bin/pip), same with virtualenvs
	 2b.) If that isn't found, then we scan PATH environment variable to
	 locate the first usable pip.

This ensures that we use the correct version of python (instead of, for
example, using python3 to try to install into a python2 virtualenv in some
cases, etc.) 


2.1.1 - May 19 2017

- distrib/runTests.py: Fix issue with obscure usage (probably not used anywhere) -- wherein
MY_PACKAGE_MODULE is defined as a .py file explicitly and not a directory.
- distrib/runTests.py: Try pip install when download fails for any reason


2.1.0 - Apr 19 2017

- Change to using deque for internal structures that only popleft

- Use "realpath" to avoid some strange issues which can occur with relative
paths

- Use OS-independent operations, which should make GoodTests.py windows
compatible again

- Some cleanups, docstrings, etc

- Simplifications on using specific test pattern (-m)

- Remove __pycache__ directory before running test (can cause issues when
using multiple branches)

- Allow using -m like -m$PATTERN in addition to -m $PATTERN

- Alert right away if specific test pattern (-m) can't be compiled as a
regular expression

- Handle terminates better, and OS-independent

- Print a message when GoodTests is terminating

- distrib/runTests.py - Update to better handle pressing control+c, first will
so a soft terminate, second will do a hard kill on GoodTests.py

- Move GoodTests.py main into a function: main(args) to make it more easily
called from a wrapper script, if required.


2.0.1 - Apr 6 2017
* Better error reporting:
	- Report on errors in class setup
	- Report on errors in class teardown
	- Note that a failure in method setup/teardown was in that method

* Exclude "GoodTests.py" code from the reported tracebacks
* Ensure we replace only the START test_ for setup/teardown names, so methods named strangely like test_Whatever_test will work

* 1.2.3 Sep 9 2016
- Update distrib/runTests.py to support older versions of python (< 2.7.9 or 3.1,3.2, some 3.3 series) which don't support relative path in imp.find_module
- Update distrib/runTests.py to be importable and functionality called from an external application (like a GUI), and even adjust the globals by passing their names to the new main() function.
- Update distrib/runTests.py add __version__ marker, some docstrings, extra comments, etc.
- Update distrib/runTests.py change default of ALLOW_SITE_INSTALL to be the intended "False", so it will only test the LOCAL version of a package (as intended during development)

* 1.2.2 Jul 25 2016
- Update distrib/runTests.py to support passing arguments to GoodTests

* 1.2.1 Jun 22 2016
- Update distrib/runTests.py to support relative test directories
- Update distrib/runTests.py to support providing a relative or absolute path
to a file or directory as MY_PACKAGE_MODULE and runTests.py will set the
PYTHONPATH such that the tests will use that directory.
- Update distrib/runTests.py adding variable ALLOW_SITE_INSTALL, when False
(default), runTests.py will refuse to run if it can only find a global install
of the given module, i.e. when False it must find a local install. This can
help during development, so you aren't testing the wrong code!

* 1.2.0 Apr 25 2016
- Disable colour by default if platform is windows
- Default number of processes to the number of CPUs on the system
- Allow "-n" to be used in more forms (like "-n 1" or "-n1")
- Update "distrib/runTests.py" script to tell if it failed, or if there were missing
dependencies (and suggest how to resolve)
- Fix distrib/runTests.py

* 1.1.4 Mar 25 2016
- Fix order of arguments in os.symlink in distrib/runTests

* 1.1.2.2 Sep 20 2015
 - Cleanup READMEs and make README.rst external
 - Fix typo in help description
 - Add MANIFEST.in to the project
 - Add "distrib" directory, which contains
