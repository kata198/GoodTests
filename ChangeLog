* 1.2.3 Sep 9 2016
- Update distrib/runTests.py to support older versions of python (< 2.7.9 or 3.1,3.2, some 3.3 series) which don't support relative path in imp.find_module
- Update distrib/runTests.py to be importable and functionality called from an external application (like a GUI), and even adjust the globals by passing their names to the new main() function.
- Update distrib/runTests.py add __version__ marker, some docstrings, extra comments, etc.
- Update distrib/runTests.py change default of ALLOW_SITE_INSTALL to be the intended "False", so it will only test the LOCAL version of a package (as intended during development)

* 1.2.2 Jul 25 2016
- Update distrib/runTests.py to support passing arguments to GoodTests

* 1.2.1 Jun 22 2016
- Update distrib/runTests.py to support relative test directories
- Update distrib/runTests.py to support providing a relative or absolute path
to a file or directory as MY_PACKAGE_MODULE and runTests.py will set the
PYTHONPATH such that the tests will use that directory.
- Update distrib/runTests.py adding variable ALLOW_SITE_INSTALL, when False
(default), runTests.py will refuse to run if it can only find a global install
of the given module, i.e. when False it must find a local install. This can
help during development, so you aren't testing the wrong code!
